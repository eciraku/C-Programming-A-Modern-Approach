/* I use a 64-bit Machine, so check your system specs for this exercise */

// (a) Days in a month -> maximum number of days: 31, so a char variable is enough to store such a value
// (b) Days in a year  -> maximum number of days: 366, so a short variable is enough
// (c) Minutes in a day -> 1440 minutes, short is again enough to store this value
// (d) Seconds in a day -> 86400 seconds, int is enough
