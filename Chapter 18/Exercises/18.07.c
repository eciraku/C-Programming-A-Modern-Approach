/*
	(a) If x is of type int, it can be used as the value of a case label in a switch statement. False
		Declaring a variable to be const does not make it a constant. The switch statement requires constant expression,
		and const variables eventhough have values that do not change can not be used as labeles in switch statements,
		because const variables cannot be used in constant expressions.
